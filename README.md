# BurgerApp
eatTheBurger
This project we had to use the MVC as well as handlebars format to become used to having calls from different files for a more organized code.

MVC is short for model view controller, this is commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides the related program logic into thrww interconnect elements.

We had to design a project that received info from the DB, and using handlebars to form an html layout, it would show the information on the page. This information was lists of burger types and each had a button for the user to click, which would "devour" or "eat-da-burger" and move the burger to the opposite side of the page.

This was done by using an ajax call in the script.js file.
